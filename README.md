# Project03-JuicyBreakout

# Project Name
Project 3 for my Game Technology course.  Due 2/24/2024

Description:

A project that is designed around giving a block-breaker type of game some serious flare, to make it look nicer to players that are trying to play the game.  This project is designed to gather all of the content learned in this section of the material, and giving the class free reign over how we want to approach this project, which was really cool in my opinion.

## Implementation
- Changing the colors on the bricks via randomization (+1)
- Squeeze and stretch the ball (+1)
- Highlighted the ball and paddle whenever they are hit (+1)
- Added sound effects to the game (+1)
- Added music to the game (+1)
- Added particles to the paddle whenever it is hit by the ball (+1)
- Added a comet trail to the ball (+1)
- Added backgrounds to all scenes using shaders (+2)

## Future Development
I plan to add smooth animations to assets in the levels regarding when they interact with specific objects to make the game feel more clean to play, escpecially the bricks as I focused mostly on ball and paddle flare, along with backgrounds and music this time around.  Adding a screen shake for when the player would lose a life would also be a cool development I could make in the future.
